### **0:00 - 0:45 | Introduction & Authentication**
"Hello and welcome to the deep-dive demonstration of the **Ocean Cleanup Application**. This platform bridges the gap between physical ocean conservation and the digital economy, empowering local communities to turn waste into value.

We begin at the **Login Screen**. The design philosophy here is 'Deep Ocean'—using dark tones with vibrant bioluminescent accents to reduce eye strain and look stunning on modern OLED screens.
I’ll use the **Fast Demo Login** to securely access the fisherman's profile."

### **0:45 - 1:30 | The Marketplace & Economy**
"We land immediately on the **Marketplace**. This is the economic engine of the app.
Notice the **Real-Time Balance** at the top. This connects directly to the user's blockchain wallet.

Below, we have the **Verified Listings**. These aren't just NFTs; they are digital twins of actual recovered debris. Use the filter tabs to switch between 'Trending', 'Latest', and 'Top'.
*   *Action: Scroll through list.*
*   *Action: Click on 'Recycled Turtle #742'*
Let's click on this 'Recycled Turtle'. You can see the **Provenance Data**: who collected it, the 'Hype Score' (which tracks community interest), and the verification status. This transparency is key to building trust in recycled materials."

### **1:30 - 3:00 | The Capture Workflow (Core Feature)**
"Now, let’s look at the Fisherman's daily tool: **The Capture Flow**.
*   *Action: Click Camera Icon.*
We’ve redesigned this to be as intuitive as a social media app. It’s titled **'New Listing'**.

**Step 1: Visual Evidence.**
The horizontal scroll allows users to quickly add photos. I'll add a collection photo now.
*   *Action: Click 'Add Photo'.*

**Step 2: Structured Data.**
We minimize typing. I'll enter 'Ghost Net' as the title and '15kg' for the weight.
*   *Action: Type Title and Weight.*
 For the category, our smart dropdown lets me quickly tag this as 'Ghost Nets'.
*   *Action: Select 'Ghost Nets' category.*

**Step 3: Verification.**
Clicking 'Continue' takes us to the **Preview Screen**. Here, the AI analyzes the image to verify the debris type and location before it hits the blockchain.
*   *Action: Click Continue. Show Preview.*
Once verified, we hit Submit.
*   *Action: Click Submit. Show Success Screen.*
And just like that, the physical collection is recorded on-chain."

### **3:00 - 4:00 | Dashboards: Fisherman & Logistics**
"The app serves multiple roles. Let's go to the **Fisher Dashboard** (the Anchor icon).
This is the command center. It tracks 'Total Plastic' and 'Carbon Offset' at a personal level. It’s simple, big, and legible in sunlight.

Now, let's look at the logistics side: The **Scraper Dashboard** (the Truck icon).
*   *Action: Click Truck Icon.*
This view is for the logistics partners who pick up the waste. They can see 'Pending Requests' from fishermen, route their pickups, and manage their fleet. It connects the collector to the processor seamlessly."

### **4:00 - 5:00 | Profile & Conclusion**
"Finally, we head to the **User Profile**.
*   *Action: Click Profile Icon.*
This summarizes the user's entire journey.
*   **Hunter Rank**: Gamifies the experience to encourage consistency.
*   **Wallet**: Shows the financial reward for their environmental service.

In summary, this application is a complete ecosystem. It handles **Identity, Commerce, Data Collection, and Logistics** in one cohesive, beautiful interface. It transforms the act of cleaning the ocean from a chore into a valued, transparent profession.

Thank you for watching."
