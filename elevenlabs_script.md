### **Clip 1: Introduction (Login)**
Hello and welcome to the deep dive demonstration of the Ocean Cleanup Application. This platform bridges the gap between physical ocean conservation and the digital economy, empowering local communities to turn waste into value. We begin at the Login Screen. The design philosophy here is Deep Ocean, using dark tones with vibrant bioluminescent accents to reduce eye strain and look stunning on modern OLED screens. I’ll use the Fast Demo Login to securely access the fisherman's profile.

### **Clip 2: Marketplace Economy**
We land immediately on the Marketplace. This is the economic engine of the app. Notice the Real-Time Balance at the top. This connects directly to the user's blockchain wallet. Below, we have the Verified Listings. These aren't just NFTs; they are digital twins of actual recovered debris. Use the filter tabs to switch between Trending, Latest, and Top. Let's click on this Recycled Turtle. You can see the Provenance Data: who collected it, the Hype Score which tracks community interest, and the verification status. This transparency is key to building trust in recycled materials.

### **Clip 3: Capture Workflow (Data Entry)**
Now, let’s look at the Fisherman's daily tool: The Capture Flow. We’ve redesigned this to be as intuitive as a social media app. It’s titled New Listing. Step 1 is Visual Evidence. The horizontal scroll allows users to quickly add photos. I'll add a collection photo now. Step 2 is Structured Data. We minimize typing. I'll enter 'Ghost Net' as the title and 15 kilograms for the weight. For the category, our smart dropdown lets me quickly tag this as Ghost Nets.

### **Clip 4: Verification & Success**
Step 3 is Verification. Clicking Continue takes us to the Preview Screen. Here, the AI analyzes the image to verify the debris type and location before it hits the blockchain. Once verified, we hit Submit. And just like that, the physical collection is recorded on-chain.

### **Clip 5: Dashboards (Fisher & Scraper)**
The app serves multiple roles. Let's go to the Fisher Dashboard, accessed via the Anchor icon. This is the command center. It tracks Total Plastic and Carbon Offset at a personal level. It’s simple, big, and legible in sunlight. Now, let's look at the logistics side: The Scraper Dashboard, accessed via the Truck icon. This view is for the logistics partners who pick up the waste. They can see Pending Requests from fishermen, route their pickups, and manage their fleet. It connects the collector to the processor seamlessly.

### **Clip 6: Profile & Conclusion**
Finally, we head to the User Profile. This summarizes the user's entire journey. It tracks their Hunter Rank, which gamifies the experience to encourage consistency, and their Wallet, which shows the financial reward for their environmental service. In summary, this application is a complete ecosystem. It handles Identity, Commerce, Data Collection, and Logistics in one cohesive, beautiful interface. It transforms the act of cleaning the ocean from a chore into a valued, transparent profession. Thank you for watching.
