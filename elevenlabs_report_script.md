### **Clip 1: Introduction & Team**
Hello, and welcome to our final presentation for the Ocean Cleanup Application. We are Group 4 and today we’re excited to share our journey in designing a platform that turns ocean plastic into digital value.

Our team consists of Jeevan Dhakal, Sridhar Vadla, and Zilong Wang. We adopted a fully collaborative approach where we all worked together on every stage of the project, including conducting interviews and defining the problem statement, running design thinking workshops and refining prototypes, and finally executing the functional requirements and this final report.

### **Clip 2: Problem & Requirements**
The core problem we addressed is the lack of economic incentive for local communities to collect ocean debris. While fishermen encounter plastic daily, there is no easy way to monetize its removal. Our solution bridges this gap by verifying physical collection on the blockchain.

To understand this domain, we conducted research with participants drawn from the local community. From this, we identified three critical requirements. First, Offline Capability: Fishermen need to log catches at sea without a stable connection. Second, Visual Verification: Recyclers need photo proof before accepting waste. And third, Speed: The data entry process must be fast to avoid disrupting their work.

### **Clip 3: Design Evolution**
Our design evolved significantly based on these requirements. Our early sketches focused on a standard 'list view' interface. However, early feedback showed this was too text-heavy and hard to read in bright outdoor conditions.

In our final prototype, we shifted to the Deep Ocean aesthetic. We used a dark background with high-contrast, bioluminescent accents to reduce eye strain and improve battery life. We replaced lists with large, touch-friendly cards for the Marketplace and Dashboard, making it easier to tap with wet or gloved hands. We also streamlined the New Listing process into just three intuitive steps: Photo, Weight, and Boat ID.

### **Clip 4: Testing Results**
For our Usability Testing, we observed participants completing core tasks like Logging a Catch and Verifying a Transaction. Users praised the Scan to Verify feature, noting it made the handover process seamless. We also resolved confusion around the Wallet terminology by renaming Crypto Balance to a simple Real-Time Balance with direct fiat conversion estimates. The new Fast Login flow reduced the time-to-access by 40% compared to our initial design. Overall, the testing confirmed that gamifying the experience with Hunter Ranks significantly increased user motivation.

### **Clip 5: Future Work & Conclusion**
Looking ahead, if we had more time, we would implement IoT Integration to connect directly to smart scales, Community Leaderboards to foster healthy competition, and fully robust offline caching for deep-sea expeditions.

In conclusion, the Ocean Cleanup App is more than just a tool; it's a sustainable ecosystem. We have successfully designed a user-friendly, high-contrast interface that meets the rigorous demands of ocean work. Now, we will switch to a live demonstration of the working prototype to show these features in action. Thank you.

### **Clip 6: Live Demo Walkthrough**
(Voiceover starts as the video shows the Login Screen)
Here is the live application. We start at the Login screen, designed for quick access. Using the **Fast Demo Login** button takes us directly to the **Fisherman Dashboard**.

(Video transitions to Dashboard)
Notice the high-contrast interface. At the top, we have the **Overview** stats like Plastic collected, replacing complex charts. Below that is the **Real-Time Balance**, showing earnings in both crypto and estimated fiat currency.

(Video shows 'Log Catch' flow)
To log a new catch, we tap the prominent 'Log Catch' button. This launches our streamlined process: First, take a photo of the debris. Second, enter the weight. And third, optinally enter the Boat ID. It is designed to be usable even with one hand.

(Video transitions to Scraper Dashboard)
Switching to the Recycler's view, we see the **Scraper Dashboard**. Here, recyclers can see pending requests from nearby fishermen. They can click **Accept** to coordinate a pickup, which validates the catch and records the transaction on the blockchain.

(Video shows Profile/Conclusion)
Finally, the **Profile** tracks total contribution and history. This loop—from collection to verification—creates a sustainable economy for ocean cleanup.
