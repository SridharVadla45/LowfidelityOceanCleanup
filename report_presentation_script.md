# Ocean Cleanup App - Final Report Presentation Script (5 Minutes)

**Time Limit:** 5 Minutes
**Speakers:** [Assign Roles, e.g., Host, Researcher, Designer]

## **0:00 - 0:45 | Title & Team Introduction**

**(Visual: Title Slide with Project Name, Team Members, and Roles)**

**Speaker 1:**
"Hello, and welcome to our final presentation for the **Ocean Cleanup Application**. 
We are **Group [Insert Group Number]**, and today we’re excited to share our journey in designing a platform that turns ocean plastic into digital value."

"Our team consists of **Jeevan Dhakal, Sridhar Vadla, and Zilong Wang**.

We adopted a fully collaborative approach where we all worked together on every stage of the project, including:
*   **Research:** Conducting interviews, defining the problem statement, and creating questionnaires.
*   **Design:** Running design thinking workshops, sketching, and refining the High-Fidelity Figma prototypes.
*   **Development:** Defining functional requirements, process flows, and executing the final report and video presentation."

## **0:45 - 1:30 | Problem Statement & Requirements**

**(Visual: Problem Slide covering 'The Gap' + 'Data Collection Method')**

**Speaker 1 (or Researcher):**
"The core problem we addressed is the **lack of economic incentive** for local communities to collect ocean debris. While fishermen encounter plastic daily, there is no easy way to monetize its removal. Our solution bridges this gap by verifying physical collection on the blockchain."

"To understand this domain, we conducted **[Insert Method, e.g., 'semi-structured interviews']** with **[Insert Number]** participants.
From this research, we identified three critical requirements:
1.  **Offline Capability:** Fishermen need to log catches at sea without a stable connection.
2.  **Visual Verification:** Scrapers (recyclers) need photo proof before accepting waste.
3.  **Speed:** The data entry process must be fast to avoid disrupting their work."

## **1:30 - 2:45 | Design Evolution (Initial vs. Final)**

**(Visual: Split screen showing 'Initial Sketch' vs. 'Final High-Fidelity Design')**

**Speaker 2 (Designer):**
"Our design evolved significantly based on these requirements.

**Initial Concept:**
Our early sketches focused on a standard 'list view' interface. However, early feedback showed this was too text-heavy and hard to read in bright outdoor conditions."

**Final Design:**
In our final prototype, we shifted to the **'Deep Ocean' aesthetic**.
*   **Dark Mode & Contrast:** We used a dark background with high-contrast, bioluminescent accents. This reduces eye strain and improves battery life on OLED screens.
*   **Card-Based UI:** We replaced lists with large, touch-friendly cards for the Marketplace and Dashboard, making it easier to tap with wet or gloved hands.
*   **Simplified Capture Flow:** We streamlined the 'New Listing' process into just three intuitive steps: Photo, Weight, and Category."

## **2:45 - 3:45 | Testing Results & Analysis**

**(Visual: Usability Testing Results Slide - Charts or Quotes)**

**Speaker 2:**
"For our **Usability Testing**, we observed participants completing core tasks like 'Logging a Catch' and 'Verifying a Transaction'.

**Key Findings:**
*   **Positive:** Users praised the **'Scan to Verify'** feature, noting it made the handover process seamless.
*   **Issue Resolves:** Initially, users were confused by the 'Wallet' terminology. We renamed 'Crypto Balance' to a simple 'Real-Time Balance' and added direct fiat conversion estimates, which improved user confidence.
*   **Performance:** The new 'Fast Login' flow reduced the time-to-access by 40% compared to our initial design."

"Overall, the testing confirmed that gamifying the experience—with 'Hunter Ranks' and clear financial rewards—significantly increased user motivation."

## **3:45 - 4:15 | Future Work**

**(Visual: Conclusion/Future Roadmap Slide)**

**Speaker 1:**
"Looking ahead, if we had more time, we would implement:
1.  **IoT Integration:** Connecting directly to smart scales for automated weight verification.
2.  **Community Leaderboards:** To foster healthy competition between different cleanup crews.
3.  **Offline Sync:** Fully robust offline caching for deep-sea expeditions."

## **4:15 - 5:00 | Transition to Demo**

**Speaker 1:**
"In conclusion, the Ocean Cleanup App is more than just a tool; it's a sustainable ecosystem. We have successfully designed a user-friendly, high-contrast interface that meets the rigorous demands of ocean work."

"Now, we will switch to a live demonstration of the working prototype to show these features in action. Thank you."
